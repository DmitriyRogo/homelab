# Homelab Setup

Welcome to my personal homelab setup. I update this periodically as I deploy or update my stack. Feel free to poke around!

A big shoutout and thank you to [TechHut](https://www.youtube.com/@TechHut) for the format. A lot of this setup is inspired from his videos!

### Additional Notes

#### Remote Access

I'm using [Twingate](https://www.twingate.com/) as my remote access tool to my Proxmox cluster when I'm away from home. They provide a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) model, unlike convential VPNs that grant broad network access. They offer a free tier which is perfect for any homelab enthusiast.

I've deployed my configuration using their Terraform provider - you can find my config [here](https://github.com/DmitriyRogo/homelab/tree/main/twingate)
